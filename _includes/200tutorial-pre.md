**Objective:** Once you got familiar with the [basics of RAML](http://raml.org/docs.html), it's time to move on and get into more complex features of the language itself, that will allow you to take full advantadge of it.

#### *Introduction*
This tutorial will guide you through a complete use case by showing how to optimize and reuse your code by applying concepts such as resourceTypes and traits and RAML utilities such as includes. The tutorial will also introduce the concept of schemas and show how to use these to validate an HTTP body.

#### *Assumptions*
You know the [basics of RAML](http://raml.org/docs.html): how to write a RAML file, resources, parameters, methods, and responses.

#### *Hands on!*
This tutorial will be explaining and showing snippets of RAML definitions. However, the best approach to learn the presneted concepts, is to hands on and play with the code.
With this purpose, you can easily setup a workspace, play and mess with the code, and reset it to any of the steps of this tutorial.
