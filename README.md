# The RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) Spec

RAML is a language for the definition of HTTP-based APIs that embody most or all of the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). The RAML specification (this document) defines an application of the [YAML 1.2 specification](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) that provides mechanisms for the definition of practically-RESTful APIs, while providing provisions with which source code generators for client and server source code and comprehensive user documentation can be created.

The current version of the RAML specification is **1.0** and can be found [here](versions/raml-10/raml-10.md).

## IMPORTANT NOTE

RAML 1.0 is currently in a Release Candidate stage to gather feedback from the community around the features introduced in this version such as annotations or types. We will release the final version for 1.0 soon by announcing it on our [blog](http://blog.raml.org/).

In the meanwhile, if you have any feedback, please report them [here](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/issues).

Current released version: 1.0 RC2
